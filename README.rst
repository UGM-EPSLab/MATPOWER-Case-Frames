Power System Simulation Toolbox (PSST) support for Agent-Based Modeling of Electricity Systems (AMES)
=====================================================================================================

PSST is an open-source Python application for the simulation and analysis of power system models.
 
Two functionalities of PSST, Security Constrained Unit Commitment(SCUC) and Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED), are used by AMES through an external call made to PSST for its Day-Ahead and Real-Time Market operations. The software implementation in PSST is carried out using the Python Optimization Modeling Objects (Pyomo) package, an open-source tool for optimization applications. For more details, please refer to Ref.[1], below. 
 
Instructions for installation and usage of PSST in support of AMES are provided in the 'INSTALLATION' and 'USAGE' files respectively.
