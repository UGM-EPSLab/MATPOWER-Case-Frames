# MATPOWER Case Frames

Parse MATPOWER case into pandas DataFrame.

Unlike the [tutorial](https://github.com/yasirroni/matpower-pip#extra-require-oct2py-or-matlabengine) on [`matpower-pip`](https://github.com/yasirroni/matpower-pip), this package supports parsing MATPOWER case using `re` instead of `Oct2Py` and Octave. After that, you can further parse the data into any format supported by your solver.

## Installation

```plaintext
pip install matpowercaseframes
```

## Usage

The main utility of `matpowercaseframes` is to help read `matpower` data in user-friendly format as follows,

```python
from matpowercaseframes import CaseFrames

case_path = 'case9.m'
cf = CaseFrames(case_path)

print(cf.gencost)
```

If you have `matpower` installed via `pip install matpower` (did not require `matpower[octave]`), you can easily navigate `matpower` case using:

```python
import os
from matpower import path_matpower # require `pip install matpower`
from matpowercaseframes import CaseFrames

case_name = 'case9.m'
case_path = os.path.join(path_matpower, 'data', case_name)
cf = CaseFrames(case_path)

print(cf.gencost)
```

Furthermore, `matpowercaseframes` also support generating data that is acceptable by `matpower` via `matpower-pip` package (require `matlab` or `octave`),

```python
from matpowercaseframes import CaseFrames

case_path = 'case9.m'
cf = CaseFrames(case_path)
mpc = cf.to_dict()

m = start_instance()
m.runpf(mpc)
```

To save all `DataFrame` to a single `xlsx` file, use:

```python
from matpowercaseframes import CaseFrames

case_path = 'case9.m'
cf = CaseFrames(case_path)

cf.to_excel('PATH/TO/DIR/case9.xlsx')
```

If you use `matpower[octave]`, `CaseFrames` also support `oct2py.io.Struct` as input using:

```python
from matpower import start_instance
from matpowercaseframes import CaseFrames

m = start_instance()

# support mpc before runpf
mpc = m.loadcase('case9', verbose=False)
cf = CaseFrames(mpc)
print(cf.gencost)

# support mpc after runpf
mpc = m.runpf(mpc, verbose=False)
cf = CaseFrames(mpc)
print(cf.gencost)

m.exit()
```
